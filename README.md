Database Connectivity
This project utilizes JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to establish a connection to an Oracle database. The appropriate Oracle JDBC driver is used to facilitate communication between the Java application and the database.

Usage
Once the server is running and the database is configured, users should run the create.sql script and then compile both source java files and run the InsertData executable. After that one can access the frontend. Note: [The database is not configured in this project. If you want to use it you need to either download oracle database locally or use a docker container.]
